# oclfootball

This is the old ocl site... the replacement is here: 

https://github.com/richsanda/ocl2

This version used to have a couple of endpoints that i don't keep up anymore:

• the front page showed the box score for the top 100 highest scoring weeks of all time
• this page showed which players are "your guys," meaning those who have contributed the most to your team, with 2018 contributions parenthesized: /stats
• this showed a ranking of season by position for every team, highlighting 2018: /seasonStats
